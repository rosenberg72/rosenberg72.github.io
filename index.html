				<h1>Education</h1>
				<h3>
					University of Wisconsin - La Crosse <br>
					Kingston University London
				</h3>
				<p>I am in my fourth year at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse. I began my studies at UWL within the field of Accounting but I am currently pursuing a degree in Marketing. Learning the infinite number of ways that value can be conveyed to consumers, and how those consumers react to that value is of great interest to me. </p>
				<p> I am also near the completion of a minor in the Spanish language, something I have studied throughout my educational career. Studying a foreign language has enriched my understanding of different cultures and has given me a great opportunity and ability to communicate and interact with individuals of different backgrounds, both in the United States and abroad. </p>
				<p> Additionally, I have spent a summer abroad at Kingston University London in 2015. The two courses I completed, Comparative Marketing Systems and Financial London provided me with yet another opportunity to experience and interact with people of different cultures and learn how businesses and relationships are maintained on a global scale. </p>

				<h1>Running</h1>
				<p>
					I am in my third season of competing for The University of Wisconsin &ndash; La Crosse Cross Country and Track & Field programs, the most successful and decorated program in NCAA Division III history. As a student-athlete, I am the president of our NCAA Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC). This committee is the main channel of communication and interaction between all student-athletes and the athletic department at UWL, as well as the NCAA. In leading the student-athletes of 17 different sports teams at UWL, I work with the athletes and administration to put on special activities and events in order to give back to those in need within the La Crosse community.

				<h1>Current Employment</h1>
				<h3><a href="http://www.grandbluffrunning.com/">Grand Bluff Running</a></h3>
				<p>
					I am currently employed at Grand Bluff Running, the first and only run specialty store in the Western Wisconsin area. In being a part of the initial planning and establishment of Grand Bluff even before opening our doors in 2014, I have become deeply involved in the promotion and growth of an extremely active community in the greater La Crosse area. Through the sales of running footwear, apparel, and accessories, interacting with the community, and working with all of the major brand sales representatives, I have learned a great deal about how the industry works and how running can really change the lives of individuals and entire communities.

				<h1>Giving Back</h1>
				<p>
					I continually work to give back my time and resources to the community where I live. Throughout my athletic seasons at UWL, I volunteer at Riverfront, Inc. in La Crosse, a day center for adults with disabilities. While here, I assist members with their work and daily activities. In my leadership of SAAC at UWL, I lead teams in annual events such as activity nights for both children and senior citizens from the surrounding areas. The Student-Athlete Advisory Committee also partners with Special Olympics Wisconsin for several fundraising events throughout the year. Finally, in 2013, I volunteered my time and skills as a head coach of a youth developmental basketball team at the La Crosse Area YMCA.
